The thumbs-up icon used in the floating button is got from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icon/85597/thumbs-up")

The demo is hosted on Github pages at [https://https://tinitto.github.io/feedback-button/](https://tinitto.github.io/feedback-button/?backendUrl=https://vuetify-feebback-api.herokuapp.com)

The floating button was heavily inspired by [Gururaj p Kharvi's codepen](https://codepen.io/androidcss/pen/MyvQgG). The CSS of the button is mostly got from that codepen. A few other CSS rules come from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com)
